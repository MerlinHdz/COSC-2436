# Chapter 11 - Sorting Algorithms and Their Efficiency

Approximate growth rates of time required for eight sorting algorithms.

* Selection sort    worst case: n^2         average case: n^2
* Bubble sort       worst case: n^2         average case: n^2
* Insertion sort    worst case: n^2         average case: n^2
* Merge sort        worst case: n x log n   average case: n x log n
* Quick sort        worst case: n^2         average case: n x log n
* Radix sort        worst case: n           average case: n
* Tree sort         worst case: n^2         average case: n x log n
* Heap sort         worst case: n x log n   average case: n x log n
